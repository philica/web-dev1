      <br></br>
     
      <p>In this course, you’ll learn all about becoming a web developer, from the responsibilities that a web developer performs on a day-to-day basis to the set of skills that you’d need to succeed in such a role. And, of course, you’ll also get your hands dirty with code: We’ll introduce you to the fundamental building blocks of the web and make sure you leave this course having developed your very first website!</p>

      <h2> Who is a web developer</h2>
      <br></br>
      <p>A web developer is at heart an interactive artist. They’re someone driven by a deep desire to create things. A web developer’s canvas is a user’s web browser.

Much like how a curious child takes pleasure in making toys by joining LEGO blocks—and then experiences a similar joy in taking things apart to see how they’re made, a web developer’s job is to use the basic building blocks of the web (like HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to create something complex like a webpage. Don’t sweat it! We’ll get into all of those terms soon.

It is also the web developer’s job to diagnose problems in a website’s functionality, to understand how something works by reading the code behind it, and to make changes to fix any issues. That essentially makes web developers the physicians of the world wide web. When we talk about the world wide web, we’re mainly referring to websites and web applications. At this point, the curious aspiring developer in you might be wondering, “What’s the difference between the two?”

Well, we’re glad you asked! A website is usually a simple page or a group of pages (the popular web comic site, xkcd, for example). However, modern websites are much more than that. Take Google Docs, for example. It has a nice interface that, once opened, looks very much like a desktop software like Microsoft Office. Such complex websites are often termed web applications. A web developer today is expected to know how to create and work with web applications. Having said that, most people use the terms interchangeably, so don’t get too hung up on the terminology!</p>

<h2>What are the skills required to become a web developer</h2>
<br></br>
<p>What does it take to become a web developer? Essentially, just three things: HTML, CSS and JavaScript—the three pillars of the web, which we’ll be learning about over the next few days. Together, these three pillars make every website work, defining the content to be displayed (HTML), telling a browser how to display that content (CSS), and making the content interactive (JavaScript), respectively.

A web developer is well versed in these three technologies. They can read other people’s code and make changes to it. They can find and debug bugs (shortcomings in existing code). A web developer might, at times, work on a new project (a new website) from scratch, or may have to work on an existing website and make it better. A typical day in the life of a web developer involves fixing bugs, developing new features (that is, enhancements) and webpages, and working with other developers to discuss ways to solve problems.

Don’t be overwhelmed by all of these details. You’ll soon see that they’re all very connected, and learning one of these automatically makes you good at a few others!

<h2>What we’ll be learning</h2>
<br/>
<p >
  No web development course is complete without a hands-on project. In this course, we’ll be using the three pillars of the web (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to build your first project, a personalized portfolio website. Once you have these under your belt, picking up other tools and languages is much easier. Pay extra attention to the basics, as a shaky foundation leads to loads of confusion later on. We’ll also give you the resources needed to put your website online so that you can share it with your friends and family.

Today, we’ll start by getting a fish eye view of the web development world. We’ll talk about the tools we’ll use in this course, and we’ll also write some HTML.

On the second day, we’ll write more HTML and HTML elements, and create the rough layout of our project website.

On day three, we’ll write some CSS to make our website mobile responsive, which means that our website will be viewable on computers, tablets, and mobile phones.

On the fourth day, we’ll dive into some advanced CSS and add cool effects to our page.

On the fifth and final day, we’ll learn how to write basic JavaScript. We’ll also look at form validations and other common elements of JavaScript programming.

To give you a tiny glimpse, this is roughly how your website will look like at the end of this course. Pretty cool, right?
